## <a name="submit-mr"></a> Submitting a Merge Request (MR)

Before you submit your Merge Request (MR) consider the following guidelines:

To the first point

1. Make your changes in a new git branch:

   > Note! The name of the new branch must have only alphanumeric chars and a hyphen.

   > Be aware! All new branches should be created from `main` branch

   ```shell
   git checkout -b my-fix-branch main
   ```

2. Create your bugfix or feature.
3. Follow our Coding Rules.
4. Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows our
   [commit message conventions](#commit). Adherence to these conventions
   is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.

   ```shell
   git commit -m 'fix: my beautiful fix'
   ```

5. Push your branch to GitHub:

   ```shell
   git push origin my-fix-branch
   ```

6. In GitHub, create a merge request to `main`.

- If we suggest changes then:

    - Make the required updates.
    - Rebase your branch and force push to your GitLab repository (this will update your Merge Request):

      ```shell
      git rebase main -i
      git push -f
      ```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

## <a name="commit"></a> Commit Message Guidelines

We have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to **more
readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**. But also,
we use the git commit messages to **generate change log**.

### Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitLab as well as in various git tools.

Footer should contain a [closing reference to an issue](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#closing-issues-automatically/) if any.

Samples: (even more [samples](https://github.com/StyleSync/stylesync-frontend/commits/main))

```
docs(): update change log to beta.5

fix(auth): fix token verification
```

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:`, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type

Must be one of the following:

- **chore**: Updating tasks etc; no production code change or changes do not respective business requirements of the client
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **deps**: Upgrading direct or dev dependencies

### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitLab issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
